            <p><i>Tutor: <b>Prof. Jean-Philippe Gastellu-Etchegorry</b> (CESBIO)</i></p>

            <p>
                <a class="text-decoration-underline" href="https://dart.omp.eu" target="_blank">DART</a> is an ever-evolving radiative transfer model. 
                It simulates the 3D radiative budget (RB) and remote sensing (RS) satellite, 
                airborne and in-situ signals (spectroradiometer, LiDAR) of urban and natural landscapes, 
                from visible to thermal infrared. It is a reference tool for a wide range of RS studies (sensitivity studies, 
                inversion of RS images, design of new RS sensor, etc.). Licenses are free for research and education. 
                This tutorial is aimed to discover and/or deepen DART theory and functionalities.

            <p><i>Tutor: <b>Noel Gorelick</b> (Google)</i></p>

            <p>
                This session is a hands-on workshop that takes participants through the basics of getting up and running with <a class="text-decoration-underline" href="https://earthengine.google.com/" target="_blank">Earth Engine</a>. 
                Participants will learn how to perform tasks such as image visualization, time-series compositing and areal statistic 
                computations using the Earth Engine API and interactive development environment.
            </p>

            <p>

            <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">EnMAP-Box: A hands-on introduction to the EnMAP-Box, a QGIS Plugin for Imaging Spectroscopy and Remote Sensing</h3>
            <p><i>Tutor: <b>Andreas Janz</b> (Humboldt University of Berlin)</i></p>

            <p>
                We show various basic and advanced components of the EnMAP-Box. Participants learn how to manage, 
                visualize and process raster and vector data inside the EnMAP-Box. We detail the multiple-viewer concept, 
                that allows the exploration of data in different visualizations at the same time. We highlight, 
                how we capitalize on the spectral characteristics of optical (hyperspectral) EO data, 
                e.g. by correctly plotting pixel profiles against the given center wavelength, or by quickly selecting target bands for visualization. 
                Finally, we perform a Regression-based Unmixing Workflow using urban EnMAP data to illustrate EO data processing inside the EnMAP-Box.

            <p><i>Tutor: <b>Dr. Michael Foumelis</b> (Aristotle University of Thessaloniki)</i></p>

            <p>
                The <a class="text-decoration-underline" href="https://geohazards-tep.eu/#" target="_blank">Geohazards Exploitation Platform</a> (GEP) is a cloud-based environment 
                providing access to satellite imagery and EO processing services that 
                allow for the mapping of hazard-prone land surfaces and monitoring of 
                terrain motion. The platform is continuously expanding to address the 
                constantly evolving objectives of the geohazards community, by integrating 
                a broad range of on-demand and systematic services hosted on cloud 
                resources. This tutorial aims to introduce the platform's interface 
                and available operational services while demonstrating its applicability 
                to the monitoring of urban environments.
