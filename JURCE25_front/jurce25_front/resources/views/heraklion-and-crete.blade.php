                <h3>Getting to <span class="gradient-horizon gradient-text">Heraklion</span></h3>

                <h4>By air</h4>

                <p>
                    The principal airport in Crete is Heraklion International Airport, “Nikos Kazantzakis” (airport code: HER). <b>It is the closest airport to the venue.</b>
                </p>

                <p>
                    It is located about 5 km east of the city centre of Heraklion and is directly connected to Athens International Airport (airport code: ATH) 
                    with several daily domestic flights run by Aegean Airlines, and SkyExpress Airlines. The flight duration from/to Athens is about 35min. 
                    During the summer period, there are also many direct scheduled airline connections from major European cities as well as many charter 
                    flights from most European countries.
                </p>

                <p>

                </p> 
                
                <h4>By boat</h4>

                <p>
                    It is also possible to arrive by boat from Piraeus (major port of Greece) to Heraklion as Minoan lines and ANEK lines provide 
                    daily ferry services from and towards Crete. In particular, at least two ferry boats sail daily to Heraklion from Piraeus. 
                    The boats sail in the evening (usually around 9-10 pm) and reach their destination early in the morning (around 5:30-6:00 am) after an 8-9 hour journey.
